# Atliq-Hospitality-Domain-analysis-using-Power-BI

**Project Pverview:**

This repository contains the Power BI project titled "Atliq-Hospitality-Domain-analysis," which focuses on analyzing and uncovering hidden opportunities for AtliQ Grands, a luxury/business hotel chain facing challenges in maintaining market share and revenue. The project aims to empower the hotel management with data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.

**Problem Statement:**

Provide insights to the Revenue team in the Atliq Hospitality Domain

**Domain**:  Hospitality       **Function**: Revenue

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.


Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

**Task:**

1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

**Solution:**

The project focuses on generating revenue insights for a fictional hotel chain, Atliq Grands, which operates multiple five-star hotels across India. The hotel chain is facing significant competition from other hotels in the market, and the goal is to build a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI that provides actionable insights for management. This dashboard will help the management understand key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, occupancy rates, and average daily rates (ADR), enabling them to make informed decisions to improve their competitive position.

**Key Business Metrics üìà**

The following key metrics were analyzed:

1. Revenue
2. RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)
3. Occupancy%
4. Realisation%
5. Cancellation%
6. No Show Rate %
7. ADR (Average Daily Rate)
8. DBRN (Direct Booking Revenue Net)
9. DSRN (Direct Sales Revenue Net)
10. DURN (Direct Upsell Revenue Net)WoW Change% (Week-over-Week Change)

**Benefits üåü**

The dashboard provides several benefits:

1. Empowered data-driven decision-making
2. Identified trends and patterns in hotel performance
3. Optimized revenue management strategies
4. Enhanced competitive positioning
